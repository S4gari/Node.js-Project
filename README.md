Node.js User Authentication API:
            This project is a Node.js API that provides endpoints for user authentication (signup and login) and user profile management. It is built using Express.js and MongoDB for data storage. Additionally, the API sends confirmation emails to users upon successful registration.

Features:
User Signup:
Endpoint: /api/signup
Allows users to register with a username, email, and password.
Validates input, hashes the password, and securely stores user data in MongoDB.
Sends a confirmation email upon successful signup.

User Login:
Endpoint: /api/login
Validates user credentials (email and password).
Generates a JWT token for authentication, which is sent back to the client.

User Profile:
Endpoint: /api/profile
Retrieves and displays the user's profile information using the JWT token provided.

Confirmation Email:
A confirmation email is sent after successful user signup using Nodemailer.
The email contains a confirmation link to verify the user's registration.

Technologies Used:
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the API.
Express.js: Web framework used to create the server and define the routes.
MongoDB: Database for storing user information.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to interact with MongoDB.
JWT (JSON Web Token): For securely transmitting information between parties.
Bcrypt.js: For hashing passwords before storing them in the database.
Nodemailer: To send confirmation emails to users after signup.
